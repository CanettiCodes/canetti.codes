            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from https://canetti.codes (the “Site”).
        </p>
        <h2>Personal information I collect</h2>
        <p>When you visit the Site, I automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, I collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. I refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information".</p>
        <p>I collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Cookies" are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org"></a>.</li>
            <li>"Log files" track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
            <li>"Web beacons", "tags", and "pixels" are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.</li>
            <li>I use Google Analytics to understand general trends about my content and traffic sources; for example, where users come from, which pages are most popular, which sites provide most traffic, how my marketing efforts impact the amount of visits I receive. Google’s statement about privacy can be found <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When I talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, I am talking both about Device Information and Order Information.</p>
        <h2>How do I use your personal information?</h2>
        <p>I use the Order Information that I collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).  Additionally, I use this Order Information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Communicate with you</li>
            <li>When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to my products or services.</li>
            <li>I use the Device Information that I collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize my Site (for example, by generating analytics about how my customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of my marketing and advertising campaigns).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sharing your personal information</h2>
        <p>I share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.  I also use Google Analytics to help us understand how my customers use the Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.  You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
        <p>Finally, I may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information I receive, or to otherwise protect my rights.</p>
        <h2>Behavioural advertising</h2>
        <p>As described above, I use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications I believe may be of interest to you.  For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work">http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work</a>.</p>
        <h2>Do not track</h2>
        <p>Please note that I do not alter my Site’s data collection and use practices when I see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>
        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information I hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact me on info[at]danielcanetti.com.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if you are a European resident I note that I am processing your information in order to fulfill contracts I might have with you (for example if you make an enquiry through the Site), or otherwise to pursue my legitimate business interests listed above.  Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.</p>
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>When you make an enquiry through the Site, I will maintain your information for my records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.</p>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>I may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to my practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>For more information about my privacy practices, if you have questions, or if you would like to make a complaint, please contact us by e-mail at info[at]danielcanetti.com.</p>
